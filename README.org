* Dotconfig files
Main desktop dotconfig files

*** Notes
- (bare) Arch linux
- Xanmod Kernel (compiled with ~MAKEFLAGS='-j14' _microarchitecture=99 use_numa=n use_tracers=n use_ns=y makepkg -sic~)

For other packages, just check pkglist for all installed with pacman explicitly (non-dependency)
Or check apkglist for the "alternative package list", this is a file of things installed that do not exist within pacman (typically AUR, might every now and then include a package that was removed)
